# Proquabet

Turn your prose into a constant stream of encrypted and meaningless-sounding five-letter words!

## What?

This will convert a string of text into ASCII codes, and then each of those characters into a [proquint][], and vice versa.

*I personally found the original paper kind of difficult to parse, so if that happens for you, try checking my [wiki page on proquints](https://www.tinybrain.fans/proquints.html) to see if that helps, as it is a more step-by-step process/how-to.*

## Why? 

I was fascinated by [proquints][] when I first saw them in [icco's Go implementation](https://merveilles.town/web/statuses/107505257480989361). I've always been interested in codes and cryptography, so I once I understood how it worked, I figured to drill it further, I should do something silly with it. So here we are, back where we started but with MORE MATH.
